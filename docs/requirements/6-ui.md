<br><br><br><br>

## 6.0 Note

For this section, `svg` graphics will be used to illustrate a Checkers board and the various hints and effects anticipated on that board.

HUD and menu elements are drawn using bitmap graphics.

**Pieces** and **Tiles** can provide colors as hints, mostly to show if they are **Selected** or **Available**. The following is used for hints:

- **Available:** *Blue*, such as on-mouse-hover, or selecting a path
- **Selected:** *Green*, such as on-mouse-click, or end of path
- **Threatened:** *Red*, such as attacked pieces, or attacking squares

See [6.11.3 Example Highlights](#6.11.3-example-highlights) for some of these.

## 6.2 Checkers Board

The **Board** is rendered to the screen as an alternating sequence of red and black squares called **Tiles**. See [6.11.1 Blank Checkers Board](#6.11.1-blank-checkers-board).

Each **Tile** can give the user a **Hint**, similarly to the **Pieces**.

**Pieces** occupy **Tiles**, and indicate such by rendering over them. It is very important that the logical position ("A-2") corresponds to the on-screen position ("256 x 122") when it is rendered.

**`R6.2.1`** Pieces render above correct tiles **Priority 1**

**`R6.2.5`** Board is 8 Tiles by 8 Tiles **Priority 1**

**`R6.2.6`** Board is rendered across most of screen **Priority 1**

**`R6.2.7`** No important part of Board is rendered Off-Screen **Priority 1**

**`R6.2.8`** Inactive Tiles do not hint at anything **Priority 2**

- **Selected:** By clicking on it
- **Threatened:** By a piece when drawing move path
- **Moved:** To a new location on the **Board**
- **Removed:** Stop rendering
- **Hinted:** The *Red*, *Green*, and *Blue* colors
