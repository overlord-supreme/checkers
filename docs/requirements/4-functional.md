               place:
               **Priority 1**
  * The capturing piece must be one tile away on the diagonal from an opponent
    piece (the captured piece). If the capturing piece is a king, the captured
    piece can be behind the king.
  * The player must be able to move the capturing piece two tiles diagonally
    such that it ends up on the opposite side of the captured piece.

               shall be able to capture a piece twice. A man shall not be able
               to do this, since it can only move forward. Capturing a piece
