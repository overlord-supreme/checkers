# 4. Non-Functional Requirements

## 4.1 Network Performance
### R?.1 Lag Management
There should be little to no lag between frames, devices, or inputs within the game. Once the session has been joined by both players, the team is assuming the lag will be small and will not negatively affect the game. In general this lag will only occur when passing the active player status between the two players. However, In order to ensure game quality, the game will be playtested before it’s released and we’ll survey the playtesters for acceptable quality. **Priority 1**

## 4.2  Operating System Requirements
### R?.1 Supported Platforms
The game is expected to support Windows 7,8.1, and 10 along with Linux. Other Operating Systems will not be tested and built for, so they are not expected to work with Overlord Supreme. **Priority 1**

## 4.3 Accessibility
### R?.1 Client Download
The Overlord Supreme client application will be downloadable from our github releases. **Priority 1**

## 4.4 Playtesting
At the end of each stable build of the game, the game will be playtested with approximately 10 college-aged players unfamiliar with the game. We believe that the playtesting will guarantee that the game's multiplayer is throughly tested, as we expect no player's machine/environment to be exactly the same. As well, the playtesting will also let us ensure the quality of the game is adequate, and that our design is interesting. For data gathering, we will also make sure that every one of our playtester's fill out a survey on what they thought about the game.
